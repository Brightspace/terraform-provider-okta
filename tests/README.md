# Golang API Examples

This directory contains a set of go programs using the Evident REST client. The examples each have their own README containing more details on what the example does.

To run any example, clone the repository and run `go run main.go` within
the example's own directory.

For example:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Brightspace/terraform-provider-evident
$ cd terraform-provider-evident/tests/basic
$ go run main.go
...
```
